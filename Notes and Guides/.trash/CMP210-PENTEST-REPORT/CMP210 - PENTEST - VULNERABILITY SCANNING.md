Next, a Nessus scan will be performed on both servers. Nessus is a robust tool with various capabilities. In this case, a basic scan and an advanced scan will be conducted.  
  
Nessus has the ability to identify specific vulnerabilities and assess their level of risk.

Now that the Nessus scan has been completed, the scan will be exported as a PDF for viewing and researching the results. Additionally, the scan will be exported as a .nessus file, which can then be imported into the Metasploit database.

# Nessus Scan Summary

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. PHP Unsupported Version Detection (TCP Port 90)
- **Risk:** Critical
- **Host:** `192.168.10.1`
- **Description:** The remote host contains an unsupported version of PHP, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.

### 2. Adobe Flash Player Unsupported Version Detection (TCP Port 445)
- **Risk:** Critical
- **Host:** `192.168.10.1`
- **Description:** The remote host has an unsupported version of Adobe Flash Player, posing significant security risks.

### 3. Multiple PHP Vulnerabilities (TCP Port 90)
- **CVEs:** `CVE-2017-11142`, `CVE-2017-11143`, `CVE-2017-11144`
- **Risk:** Critical
- **Host:** `192.168.10.1`
- **Description:** Various vulnerabilities in PHP versions prior to 5.6.31.

### 4. More PHP Vulnerabilities (TCP Port 90)
- **CVEs:** `CVE-2019-9020`, `CVE-2019-9021`, `CVE-2019-9023`, `CVE-2019-9024`
- **Risk:** Critical
- **Host:** `192.168.10.1`
- **Description:** Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP versions prior to 5.6.40.

### 5. PHP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (TCP Port 90)
- **CVE:** `CVE-2019-11043`
- **Risk:** Critical
- **Host:** `192.168.10.1`
- **Description:** A critical vulnerability in certain PHP versions allowing remote code execution.

## High-Risk Vulnerabilities

### 1. SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (TCP Port 3389)
- **Risk:** High
- **Hosts:** `192.168.10.1`, `192.168.10.2`
- **Description:** The remote service supports the use of medium strength SSL ciphers, reducing the security of encrypted communications.

- **Risk:** High
- **Host:** `192.168.10.1`
- **Description:** Several vulnerabilities in PHP 5.6.x, prior to version 5.6.39.

## Recommendations
- **Upgrade PHP:** Ensure all systems run supported PHP versions, ideally the latest stable release, to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Replace Adobe Flash Player:** Remove or replace Adobe Flash Player due to its end-of-life status.
- **Review SSL Configurations:** Update SSL configurations to use stronger ciphers and disable support for medium strength ciphers.

_Remedy critical vulnerabilities promptly to improve network security. Regular updates and patch management are essential for security against known vulnerabilities._
