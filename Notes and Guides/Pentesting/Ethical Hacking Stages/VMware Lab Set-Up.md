# Ethical Hacking Lab Setup Guide 🛠️

This document is a comprehensive guide for setting up a virtual lab environment tailored for ethical hacking practice and learning, using VMware and various other tools. It is designed to assist users in configuring a controlled environment where they can apply the concepts and techniques outlined in the provided ethical hacking notes.

## Prerequisites 📋

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **VMware Workstation or VMware Player**: Essential for creating and managing virtual machines.
  - Download: [VMware Products](https://www.vmware.com/products.html) 💾
- Adequate hardware resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space) to run multiple virtual machines.
- Basic understanding of virtualization, networking, and system administration.

## Lab Components 🧩

The lab environment comprises several components, each serving a specific purpose in the ethical hacking learning process:

1. **Tutorial Network**: A network setup for guided tutorials and exercises.

## Extracting Vulnerability Setup Files 📦

An essential step in preparing your lab is to extract the Vulnerability Setup files. These files include the crucial `setup.ps1` script needed for configuring the lab environment.

- **Vulnerability Setup Files**: Contains scripts and configurations for setting up vulnerabilities in the lab.
  - Download: [Vulnerability Setup Files](https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZXq4sZ3BCvJ6L6NNHouD8siHp3Wkg9ToCV) 📂

### Steps to Extract and Use:

1. **Download the Files**: Use the provided link to download the Vulnerability Setup Files.

2. **Extract the Files**: After downloading, extract these files to a convenient and easily accessible location on your system, such as `C:\temp.

3. **Locate `setup.ps1`**: Within the extracted files, find the `setup.ps1` script. This script is pivotal for the next steps in the lab setup process.

## Lab Setup Instructions 📝

1. **Read the PDF Guide**: Begin by reading the provided PDF guide for detailed instructions on setting up the lab.

2. **Disable Antivirus Temporarily**: In the extracted folder, locate and run the 'disable defender' file as an administrator to prevent interference during setup.

3. **Navigate to Setup Script**: Using PowerShell, navigate to the directory containing the `setup.ps1` file. For example:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\temp
   ```

4. **Run the Setup Script**: Ensure that `server1` and `server2` are running, then execute the setup script:
   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

   In case of execution policy errors, try the following fixes:
   - Change the execution policy:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```
   - Bypass Execution Policy for a Single Script:
     ```powershell
     PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1
     ```


5. **Post-Setup Actions**: After running the script, locate the `students.txt` file in the same directory. Each student will have different vulnerabilities assigned. Remember to re-enable your antivirus and consider taking offline snapshots of the machines for safety.

## Conclusion 🎓

This guide provides the necessary steps to set up a virtual lab for practicing ethical hacking. It is crucial to follow each step carefully and ensure that the environment is secure and isolated from your main network to prevent any unintended security risks.
