Now that the NMAP scan has been completed, enumeration can be performed. Enumeration is used to gain further insights and information about the target. For instance, tools like enum4linux can be employed to determine the password policy or to identify all the users on the server. Additionally, these users may have accompanying descriptions and information, which sometimes include their passwords.

entering the following command into the Kali Linux terminal
```bash
enum4linux -a -u test -p test123 192.168.10.2 > enum4linux-192.168.10.2-12.25.2023.txt
```

By running the above command we were able too do two things, One was getting all the active users on the server, along with their usernames. Two we were able to find a password in one of the descriptions of a user the password we were able to find was **trainmen63** 

to confirm this was their current password we logged on to the server. with the username and the password for this person. with a tool called **Evil-WinRM** 
`H.Mclaughlin : trainmen63`
