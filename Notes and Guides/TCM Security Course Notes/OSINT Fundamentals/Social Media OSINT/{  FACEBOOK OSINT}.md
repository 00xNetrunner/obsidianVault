## { SEARCHING FACEBOOK }#:
![[Pasted image 20240616141840.png]]

I am going to assume anyone reading this will know how to conduct basic searches on Facebook, like searching for a person on Facebook, you can search for people by City, Education, Friends of Friends or By Job.

You get the idea for example if i wanted to find the Zucc, most of know he went to Harvard so i would put Harvard in for his education.

What if someone profile is private, and we want to find photos of them, photos we can run through lens and PimEye

all we would need to do is search `photos of mark zuckerberg`\

And like that we have found old photos of zucc that his friends and family have posted, we can add all of this information to out OSINT Document. 

## { Sowdust }#:

Sowdust is a tool that helps us swift through information of Facebook more effectively, it allows us to search, for posts, people, photos, videos, places, etc ..

## { Intelligence X }#:

intelligenceX is a great website for OSINT,it can search for alot of different things that can be useful to a hacker for example it can find people, backtracks IP Addresses, searches for leaked emails, Phone Numbers, Images. you get the idea

### Finding userID

> [!important]
> 
> Please not both these tools are pretty hint in miss, privacy has got a lot better on facebook, it makes finding people on Social Media Sites a lot harder, Good for the person, bad for the investigation. 

Both of these searches offer an option to use IDs to find a facebook id for a profile. go to the profile you want to find the ID of right click > Inspect Page Source it will bring you to a confusing page that looks like this. 
![[Pasted image 20240616153852.png]]

all we do from here is Ctrl+F, and search for `userID`
![[Pasted image 20240616154118.png]]

We can then use this ID to get better search results  This can also be down with groups,
