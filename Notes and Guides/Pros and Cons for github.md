### **Cons of Using GitHub**

1. **Learning Curve for New Users**

   - **Lack of Familiarity:** Some team members are not familiar with GitHub or its desktop application, which may lead to initial confusion or slow down progress.
   - **Training Required:** Time may need to be allocated to teach team members how to use GitHub effectively.

2. **Not Specialized for Penetration Testing**

   - **Lack of Specialized Tools:** GitHub does not include features specifically designed for penetration testing activities, such as vulnerability management or reporting tools.

3. **Dependence on Internet Access**

   - **Connectivity Requirements:** Requires reliable internet access to interact with the repository, which could be a hindrance if team members have limited connectivity.

4. **Limited Access Control Granularity**

   - **Basic Permission Settings:** While sufficient for most projects, GitHub's permission settings may not offer the granular control that some teams might prefer, though this is less of a concern if sensitive data is not involved.

5. **Potential Overhead for Small Projects**

   - **Complexity for Simple Tasks:** For small or straightforward projects, GitHub's features might be more extensive than necessary, potentially adding unnecessary complexity.

6. **Time Investment**

   - **Setup and Maintenance:** Initial setup and ongoing repository maintenance may require additional time and effort, especially for those unfamiliar with the platform.
