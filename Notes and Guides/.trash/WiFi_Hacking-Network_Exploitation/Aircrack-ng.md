# Aircrack-ng Cheatsheet 🚀

Aircrack-ng is a network security toolkit for auditing wireless networks. This cheatsheet summarizes key tools and usage.

## 1. Airmon-ng ⚙️

Puts wireless card into monitor mode to passively sniff packets.

```
airmon-ng start wlan0

```

- Starts monitor mode on `wlan0` interface
- Creates a virtual monitor interface like `wlan0mon`

To stop monitor mode:

```
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```

## 2. Airodump-ng 📡

Captures raw 802.11 packets and detects wireless networks.

To capture all packets:

```
airodump-ng wlan0mon
airodump-ng wlan1 --band a //This will scan through 5ghz
```

For a specific network:

```
airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w [filename] wlan0mon

```

- `c`: Wireless channel to listen on
- `-bssid`: BSSID of target network
- `w`: Prefix for output file to write packets to

Airodump-ng captures network details including:

- BSSID, SSID, channel
- Encryption type
- Connected clients and MAC addresses
- IVs captured

## 3. Aireplay-ng 💥

Injects frames to generate traffic for cracking.

Deauthenticate a connected client:

```
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a [BSSID] -c [client MAC] wlan0mon

```

- `0`: Deauthentication attack mode
    
- `1`: Number of deauth packets to send (1)
    
- `a`: AP BSSID
    
- `c`: Client MAC address
    

Forces AP to generate new initialization vectors for cracking.

## 4. Aircrack-ng 🔓

Cracks WEP, WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK keys.

To crack a WEP key:

```
aircrack-ng -a 1 -b [BSSID] [capture.cap]

```

For WPA/WPA2 with passphrase dictionary attack:

```
aircrack-ng -a 2 -b [BSSID] -w [dictionary.txt] [capture.cap]

```

Where `-w` specifies the wordlist file.

## 5. Conversion to .pcapng ⚙️

Use tshark to convert `airodump-ng` `.cap` files to `.pcapng`:

```
tshark -r [input.cap] -w [output.pcapng]

```

## 📡 **Airmon-ng Guide**

- **Listing Capture Devices**
    
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng
    ```
    
    - **Setting Capture Device to Monitor Mode**
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
        ```
        
    
    ## **📡 Airodump-ng Guide**
    
    - **Starting the Scan**
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo airodump-ng wlan0
        ```
        
    - **Scanning 5GHz Channels**
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo airodump-ng wlan0 -b a
        ```
        
    - **Scanning Both 5GHz and 2.4GHz Channels**
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo airodump-ng wlan0 -b abg
        ```
        
    - **Interactions While Scanning** 🔄
        
        - **`Tab`** + **`a`**: Cycles through display options
        - **`Tab`** + **`o`**: Displays color
    
    (Additional interactions include **`s`**, **`d`**, and **`r`** which sort the visible list based on Power, BSSID, and Channel respectively. **`p`** will pause the sorting.)
    
    note using tab then m marks AP points and will also highlight what is connected to them
    
    - **Filtering Through Stations (STA)**
        
        - To see devices in the area connected to an AP
    - **Identifying Device Types with MAC Address**
        
        - First 3 octets of a MAC address reveal the device type (e.g., BC:DD:C2 → Espressif Inc. device)
        - Use **[Wireshark's OUI Lookup Tool](https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html)**
    - **Targeting a Specific Network for Packets**
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo airodump-ng wlan0 -c 6 --bssid C8:33:E5:67:08:82
        ```
        
    - **Saving a Handshake** 🤝
        
        - Very important for later cracking
```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0 -c 6 --bssid C8:33:E5:67:08:82 -w capture
```
