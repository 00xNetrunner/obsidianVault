## Anatomy of a Shell
All OS system will have its own shell, we access these shells via a **terminal emulator**

the most common of these are programs like `PuTTY`, `Windows Terminal`,  `kitty`, and my favourite `Alacritty`

### Shell Validation
To find out what sort of lanuagh our shell is currently using. we can use the `ps`  command

As you can see when i run this command the language on my shell is fish, as i use fish as me default shell, you can also get `zsh` and `bash` which is probably the most  common shell, most linux distro will use bash fresh out the box.

## Bind Shells
So with bind shells the target system with all the listener and it will be awaiting the pen-testers connection. this could be start via the hacker, being on site and having access to the victims system, and plugging in a USB, to start the listener, the hacker will then connect via their machine to the listener

their will be a lot of issue trying to get a shell via bind shells:
- ==There would have to be a listener already started on the target.==
- ==If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.==
- ==Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network (public-facing), so we would need to be on the internal network already.==
- ==Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.==

### Practising with GNU Netcat. 
Lets have a bash at doing our bind shell. 

## Reverse Shell
Using a rev shell this time the pen tester system will be set up with the listener
