## 🚀 Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

- **🌟 Start Autopsy**: Open Autopsy and create a new case or open an existing one where you want to analyze your disk image.
- **📁 Add Data Source**: Import the disk image of John Doe's computer (`johnDoe.dd`) into your case. This process may take some time as Autopsy processes and indexes the files contained within the image.

## 🗂 Step 2: Import the Whitelist

- **⚙️ Navigate to the Hash Database Configuration**:
  - In Autopsy, go to "Tools" > "Options".
  - In the Options window, click on the "Hash Sets" tab.
- **✨ Create a New Hash Set for the Whitelist**:
  - Click on the "New Set" button.
  - Provide a name for your hash set, e.g., "Windows XP Whitelist".
  - Choose "MD5" as the Hash Type.
  - Set the "Usage" to "Known" since this hash set represents known good files from a clean Windows XP installation.
  - Click "OK" to create the hash set.
- **🔍 Import the Whitelist**:
  - With your new hash set selected, click on the "Import" button.
  - Locate and select your whitelist file (`winXP.md5List.txt`).
  - Follow the prompts to import the hashes. Autopsy will add these hashes to the hash database under the set name you specified.

## ⚡️ Step 3: Configure the Ingest Modules

- **🖥 Add Data Source to Your Case**:
  - If you haven't already, add the disk image (`johnDoe.dd`) as a data source to your case. Right-click your case and choose "Add Data Source", then follow the prompts.
- **🔧 Configure Ingest Modules**:
  - When adding the data source, you’ll be prompted to configure ingest modules. Ensure the "Hash Lookup" module is enabled.
  - Configure the "Hash Lookup" module to use your newly created whitelist (e.g., "Windows XP Whitelist"). Ensure it's set to flag files that are **not** in the hash set, as you're interested in files that do **not** match the whitelist.

## 🏃‍♂️ Step 4: Run the Ingest Modules

- **▶️ Start the Ingest Process**: After configuring the ingest modules, start the ingest process. Autopsy will analyze the disk image, comparing each file's hash against your whitelist among other tasks.
- **🔎 Review the Results**:
  - Once the ingest process is complete, navigate to the "Results" view in Autopsy.
  - Look for the "Hashset Hits" section to find files that did not match your whitelist, indicating they are not part of the standard Windows XP installation.

## 📸 Step 5: Filter for Specific File Types

- **🖼 Since you're specifically interested in `.jpg` and `.bmp` files**, you'll need to further filter the results.
- **🔍 Use the "File Type" filter** in the "Views" section to isolate image files. Alternatively, you can use the search functionality to query for files with `.jpg` and `.bmp` extensions specifically.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Step 6: Manual Review

- **👀 Examine the Filtered Files**: Go through the filtered list of files that are not part of the whitelist and are of the specific file types you're interested in. Autopsy provides a preview, metadata, and other analysis tools to help you assess the relevance of each file.

## 📝 Step 7: Document Your Findings

- **📊 For each file of interest**, document your findings. You can tag files, add comments, and generate reports within Autopsy to support your investigation and any subsequent reporting.
