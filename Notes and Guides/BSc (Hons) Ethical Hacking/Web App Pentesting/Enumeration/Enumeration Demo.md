In this demonstration we are going to be using 3 tools 

- [Assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder) -  Assetfinders uses data sources from websites like wayback machine to find potential domains within a subdomain. 
- [httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) -  will take a list of domains and and try to find https and http servers 
- [gowitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness) - will take screenshots of web interfaces like the admin

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> All these tools will be preinstalled with kali linux. 


Use hackerone to find a campaign to practice on

today the target is going to be Abertay. as its in tutorial video. 

first we are going to use Assetfinder, with all tools the first command you should try is -h to bring up the help menu of if the tool is more complex use the man command. 

> [!warning] Legal Notice
> We can do this legally as this is just passive recon

lets run assetfinder use the following command: 
```bash
assetfinder -subs-only abertay.ac.uk > domains
```
> `>` this will save results to domains

it would take us ages to click every single one of these links to see what was in them so we can use the next tool on the list. to sort through the links.
