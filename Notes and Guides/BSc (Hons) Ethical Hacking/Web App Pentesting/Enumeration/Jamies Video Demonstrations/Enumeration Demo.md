In this demonstration we are going to be using 3 tools 

- [Assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder) -  Assetfinders uses data sources from websites like wayback machine to find potential domains within a subdomain. 
- [httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) -  will take a list of domains and and try to find https and http servers 
- [gowitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness) - will take screenshots of web interfaces like the admin

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> All these tools will be preinstalled with kali linux. 


Use hackerone to find a campaign to practice on

today the target is going to be Abertay. as its in tutorial video. 

first we are going to use Assetfinder, with all tools the first command you should try is -h to bring up the help menu of if the tool is more complex use the man command. 

> [!warning] Legal Notice
> We can do this legally as this is just passive recon

lets run assetfinder use the following command: 
```bash
assetfinder -subs-only abertay.ac.uk > domains
```
> `>` this will save results to domains


i got loads of results when i did this.

it would take us ages to click every single one of these links to see what was in them so we can use the next tool on the list. to sort through the links. first we can check how many domains we have with a command like `wc -l domains`

to use httprobe we are going to add it on to the assetfinder command, by using a pipe `|` this tells the terminal to run Assetfinder first then feed the information into a new command. in this case httprobe. the command will look like this. 

```bash
assetfinder -subs-only abertay.ac.uk | httprobe > live
```
> This will take some time. results will be added to live, this will get rid of all the websites that aren't in use.

httprobe will check if the site is accessible, but will also show us https and http sites this is useful because http sites are way less secure. 

### Using Go witness
```bash 
gowitness file -f ../live
```

gowitness will go through all the saved live domains and take screenshots of them. if you go to the folder where you ran this command you will see all the screenshots.
