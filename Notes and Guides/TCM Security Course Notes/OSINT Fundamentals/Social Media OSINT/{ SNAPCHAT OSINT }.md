# { SNAPCHAT MAPS }#:

> [!important]
> Listen this note is pretty pointless, Use snapchat maps to find information about people, if you know where your target is, or lives you can click on that areas on maps to find out stories posted by them and if you have snapchat premium you can see where they have been during the day. when using snap maps, you can sometimes see where they are or they can be taking a picture of their house and its address
