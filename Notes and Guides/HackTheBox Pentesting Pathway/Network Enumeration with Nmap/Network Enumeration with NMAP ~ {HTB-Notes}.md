## Saving Nmap outputs

We can preserve an Nmap scan using the -oA flag; this action stores the Nmap scan as gnmap, XML, and nmap files. To convert the Nmap scan into an HTML file, we can utilise a tool named xstproc, which facilitates the transformation of the XML file into a .html format, ensuring it is readily accessible.
```bash
$ xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

## Filtering NMAP Scans

We can use tools like *grep* an *wc* to filter through our nmap scans, for example if we wanted to see how many ports are open on our target machine we could first save the NMAP as a text file with `-oN` 

From a saved nmap scan
```shell-session
netrunner404@htb[/htb]$ cat tnet.default | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```
Or Directly from nmap
```bash
netrunner404@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```

## Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

### ACK-Scan
Sometimes NMAP's TCP ACK Scans (-sA) can bypass firewalls and IDS/IPS often more effectively that the SYN Scans (-sS) can.
```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sA -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
```
### Decoy Scan
To avoid or bypass firewalls we can use NMAP's Decoy scanning method (-D) this will disguise your real up among fake decoy IPs. we can generate random (`RND`) a specific number (for example: `5`) of IP addresses separated by a colon (`:`).
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5
```

### Testing Firewall Rule
```bash
netrunner404@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p445 -O

### Scan by using Different IP Source

### DNS Proxying

Nmap by default uses reverse DNS resolution on UDP port 53, which is generally allowed because web servers are meant to be accessible. However, with IPv6 and DNSSEC, more DNS requests are shifting to TCP port 53. Nmap lets you choose specific DNS servers (--dns-server), beneficial in sensitive network areas like a DMZ, using the company's trusted DNS servers. You can also set TCP port 53 as the source port for scans (--source-port), potentially bypassing firewalls or IDS/IPS if they're not filtering this port correctly, making your scans more likely to be trusted and allowed through.

### SYN-Scan of a Filtered Port
```bash
netrunner404@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

### SYN-Scan From DNS Port

Now that we have found out that the firewall accepts `TCP port 53`, it is very likely that IDS/IPS filters might also be configured much weaker than others. We can test this by trying to connect to this port by using `Netcat`.
