## Authentication and Session Management - Password, Cookies and More!
https://youtu.be/q7aw3AIdHBI

### 1. Authentication and Session Management

- **Authentication** verifies user identity via login panels requesting usernames and passwords.
- **Session Management** tracks users after login, ensuring seamless interaction with the web application.

### 2. Vulnerabilities in Login Panels

- Login panels are targeted for attacks, especially those with weak passwords or exposed **admin panels**.
- Poor management of login mechanisms can lead to security breaches, such as **username enumeration** and brute-force password attacks.

### 3. Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Traditional username-password combinations are evolving, with MFA (e.g., **email codes**, **authenticator apps**, **QR logins**) adding security layers.
- Implementing MFA incorrectly, however, can introduce new security risks.

### 4. Session Tokens and Cookies

- **Session tokens** track logged-in user activity, typically stored in **cookies**.
- Mismanagement of tokens or cookies, like saving sensitive user data, can lead to significant vulnerabilities.
- Tokens should be securely transferred to avoid session hijacking.

### 5. OAuth and External Authentication

- **OAuth** allows login via external platforms (e.g., **Google** or **Facebook**).
- Improper implementation can leave the system vulnerable to attacks.

### 6. Best Practices for Secure Authentication

- Avoid storing sensitive data in cookies; store **session data server-side** and reference it with tokens.
- Ensure tokens are transferred securely to prevent session hijacking.
- Use **multi-factor authentication** with appropriate security measures.
