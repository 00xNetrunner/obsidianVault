1. **`netsh`**: This is the command-line scripting utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify the network configuration of a computer that is currently running. It provides a scripting feature that allows you to run a group of commands in batch mode against a specified computer.
    
2. **`firewall`**: This is the context within `netsh` that refers specifically to the settings of the Windows Firewall. It allows you to configure and manage firewall settings.
    
3. **`add portopening`**: This part of the command is used to add a new port opening rule to the firewall settings. It's specifying an action within the `firewall` context.
    
4. **`TCP`**: This specifies the protocol type for the port opening. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols in the TCP/IP networks. The other option you could have here is UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
    
5. **`1000`**: This is the port number you are opening. Port 1000 in this case. Ports are digital channels for your computer to communicate with other computers or services.
    
6. **`"Service Firewall"`**: This is a custom name given to the rule you're creating. It's useful for identifying this specific port opening in your firewall settings.
    
7. **`ENABLE`**: This option enables the port opening. The opposite command would be `DISABLE`, to close or deactivate a port.
    
8. **`ALL`**: This defines the scope of the rule. `ALL` means the rule applies to all network profiles (like domain, private, and public). Other options could be specifying a particular network type.
