# Sock Puppet Account Overview `fas:UserSecret`

**Sock Puppet Accounts** are fake accounts that hackers set up on social media websites to gather information. Some sites, like Instagram and Facebook, only allow you to view profile information if you have an account, follow them, or have them as a friend. These accounts are also used to communicate with the person to collect more information.

> [!tip] 
> Sock Puppet Accounts** can be particularly effective for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigations due to their ability to access restricted information and facilitate covert interactions.
