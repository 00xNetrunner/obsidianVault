## Domain Information

A great way we can find information on Sub Domains is [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) This source is [Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) logs. Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections.

![[Pasted image 20240129160213.png]]

We can use the curl command to filter through the data 

*Curl with jq*
```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=socialistworker.co.uk\&output\=json | jq .
```

![[Pasted image 20240129160917.png]]


*Filter by unique subdomains*
```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=socialistworker.co.uk\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
```

**Company Hosted Servers**

First lets save the json output we can do this with the following command
```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=socialistworker.co.uk\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u > subdomains
```

This will save the output above into a text file.  we now need to mach these sub domains up to the IP. we can do this my entering the following
```bash
for i in $(cat subdomains); do host "$i" | grep "has address" | grep socialistworker.co.uk | cut -d" " -f1,4; done
```
![[Pasted image 20240129163406.png]]

by modifying the command slightly we can then filter this through a Shodan search. 
```bash
for i in $(cat subdomains); do host "$i" | grep "has address" | grep socialistworker.co.uk | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done

## Then

for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done
```

**Script that automates the above process**

Let us look at what we have learned here and come back to our principles. We see an IP record, some mail servers, some DNS servers, TXT records, and an SOA record.

- `A` records: We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record. Here we only see one that we already know.
    
- `MX` records: The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. Since this is handled by google in our case, we should note this and skip it for now.
    
- `NS` records: These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider.
    
- `TXT` records: this type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as [SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208), [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489), and [DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376), which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent. Here we can already see some valuable information if we look closer at the results.

**Domain Information**
```bash
...SNIP... TXT     "MS=ms92346782372"
...SNIP... TXT     "atlassian-domain-verification=IJdXMt1rKCy68JFszSdCKVpwPN"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=O7zV5-xFh_jn7JQ31"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=bow47-er9LdgoUeah"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=gZsCG-BINLopf4hr2"
...SNIP... TXT     "logmein-verification-code=87123gff5a479e-61d4325gddkbvc1-b2bnfghfsed1-3c789427sdjirew63fc"
...SNIP... TXT     "v=spf1 include:mailgun.org include:_spf.google.com include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:_spf.atlassian.net ip4:10.129.24.8 ip4:10.129.27.2 ip4:10.72.82.106 ~all"
```

For example, [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) states that the company uses this solution for software development and collaboration. If we are not familiar with this platform, we can try it for free to get acquainted with it.

[Google Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/) indicates that Google is used for email management. Therefore, it can also suggest that we could access open GDrive folders or files with a link.

[LogMeIn](https://www.logmein.com/) is a central place that regulates and manages remote access on many different levels. However, the centralization of such operations is a double-edged sword. If access as an administrator to this platform is obtained (e.g., through password reuse), one also has complete access to all systems and information.

[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) offers several email APIs, SMTP relays, and webhooks with which emails can be managed. This tells us to keep our eyes open for API interfaces that we can then test for various vulnerabilities such as IDOR, SSRF, POST, PUT requests, and many other attacks.

[Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/) is another indicator for document management. Companies often use Office 365 with OneDrive and cloud resources such as Azure blob and file storage. Azure file storage can be very interesting because it works with the SMB protocol.

The last thing we see is [INWX](https://www.inwx.com/en). This company seems to be a hosting provider where domains can be purchased and registered. The TXT record with the "MS" value is often used to confirm the domain. In most cases, it is similar to the username or ID used to log in to the management platform.

## FTP

**File Transfer Protocol** (**FTP**) Is one of the the oldest protocols on the internet. FTP runs within the application layer of the TCP/IP Protocol stack. Thus, so its on the same layer as HTTP and POP. HTTP and POP work with the support of browsers and email clients. so that means that FTP has its own special programs that support the service. 

### TFTP 
Stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol. its a lot simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes, however is lacks user authentication and other caluable features supported by FTP. in addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses UDP. 

lets hack a look at some of the commands for **TFTP**

| **Commands** | **Description** |
| ---- | ---- |
| `connect` | Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers |
| `get` | Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.  |
| put |  |
